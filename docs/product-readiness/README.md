# Product Readiness

Regenerate with `python3 docs/product-readiness/tools/cli.py render`.
Readiness is a customer-journey claim; it is not learner completion, evidence, verification, or mastery.

| Use case | Surface | Intended tier | Current status | Promise |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `literacy-standalone-first-lesson` | literacyDojo | `customer-ready` | `unassessed` | Complete an assigned lesson, recover from an incorrect attempt, and understand the local result. |

## Status note

`unassessed` means the intended promise has canonical scenarios and guides but no promoted independent assessment.
Published decisions can also be `pass`, `conditional-follow-up`, `downgraded`, `blocked`, or `stale`.
A runnable engine or passing producer test does not grant a readiness tier.
