## 2025-02-17 - Pre-compute Static State for Repeated Renders
**Learning:** In highly dynamic SPA architectures built on vanilla string templates (like codexDojo), operations such as `.filter()` or `.find()` inside rendering or state evaluation loops create unnecessary array allocations or O(n) scans.
**Action:** When working with static, known-at-boot configuration (like `projects` or `cycleStages`), pre-compute default fallbacks using IIFEs and replace high-frequency array manipulations with fast O(1) structures (like Counters or Maps) to alleviate main thread pressure.

## 2024-02-12 - Avoid array allocations in hot paths for counts
**Learning:** In codexDojo, calculating list lengths dynamically using `.filter(...).length` allocates unnecessary intermediate arrays, increasing GC pressure.
**Action:** Replace `.filter(...).length` with loop-based counters when a total count is needed instead of the actual array elements, and move static `.find()` resolutions to module scope to avoid repeated O(N) scans.

## 2025-02-13 - [Avoid GC pressure in loop structures]
**Learning:** In codexDojo, simple `array.filter().length` expressions cause unexpected garbage collection pressure due to temporary array allocations on the render/progress paths.
**Action:** Prefer simple loops with counters over functional array derivations (like `.filter(...)`) when aggregating state or computing metrics.

## 2024-05-18 - Avoid array allocations for counting in codexDojo
**Learning:** Using `.filter(...).length` inside render paths or frequently called getters causes unnecessary intermediate array allocations, increasing garbage collection pressure and potentially causing jank in vanilla JS applications like codexDojo.
**Action:** Use a simple `for` loop with a counter instead of `.filter(...).length` when counting items based on a dynamic condition, especially in code paths that run often like state derived getters or render loops.
## 2025-02-19 - Pre-compute Maps for Auto-Generated Data
**Learning:** Auto-generated files (like `data/cycle.ts`) cannot have optimizations directly added to them. We must place the O(1) lookup maps in adjacent logic modules (like `cycle.ts` or `progress.ts`) to avoid losing the optimizations on the next codegen run.
**Action:** When optimizing lookups on generated static arrays, initialize the O(1) Maps in the modules that consume them (or a dedicated wrapper), not the generated file itself.
