# Security Report: WebSocket Chat Server

> **Cycle:** 05_websocket_chat · **Generated:** 2026-07-02
> DoD §7: *"security/report.md with no critical findings."*

## Scope

Static review of the go, rust, node implementations against the spec. This is a
single-node, in-memory system (no external dependencies, no persistence, no network ingress
beyond localhost unless the project's concept is an auth/network service — see `spec.md`).
Threat model: input-validation failures, unsafe deserialization, boundary checks, and any
authn/authz logic specific to the project.

## Findings

- [ ] [NODE] Display-name sanitization only truncates length
- [ ] [NODE] Runtime validation is the right next TypeScript lesson

## Verdict

**⚠️ findings flagged — review mitigations below.**

## Mitigations

- Treat all client input as untrusted; validate at the serialization boundary before it touches
  internal state.
- If the project persists data or listens on a non-localhost interface, add secret management,
  TLS, and rate-limiting before any deployment beyond the lab.
- Re-run this review against any production-facing variant — the lab scope explicitly excludes
  supply-chain and infra threats.
